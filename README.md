# Customer-Churn-Analysis
Why are our Customers leaving? How can we stop them? Which segments should we focus on? What is our strength? Where did we fail?

Customer Churn rate is the number of customers who left within a time period divided by the number of active customers at the start of that period. 
Telephone service companies, Internet service providers, pay TV companies, insurance firms, and alarm monitoring services, 
often use customer attrition rates as one of their key business metrics because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less 
than acquiring a new one. 
Companies from these sectors often have customer service branches which attempt to win back defecting clients, because recovered long-term customers can be worth much more to a company than newly recruited clients. In Customer Churn Analysis, we wish to predict which customers are likely to churn and retain them. 
In this endeavor, we would like to recognise the factors that lead to churn and seal the leaking bucket.

**What tools did we use?**
1. Logistic Regression with L1 Regularisation with Hyperparameter Optimization
2. Visual Exploration of Data
3. Correlation Matrix Heatmap

**Recommendations to the Marketing Team**
 1: Focus greater attention to secure yearly contracts and longer tenures
 2: Focus greater attention to businesses who get multiple lines, internet lines and fixed tenures
 3: Involve more people into being partners
 4: Tech support should be strengthened and people should be encouraged to talk with tech support for any trouble. Tech support should be pushed as a company strength.
